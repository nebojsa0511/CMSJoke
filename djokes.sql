INSERT INTO `djokes` VALUES (68, 'A Microsoft Christmas', 'Holiday', 'NORTH POLE (API) - MICROSOFT announced an agreement with Santa Claus Industries to acquire Christmas at a press conference held via satellite from Santa''s summer estate somewhere in the southern hemisphere. In the deal, Microsoft would gain exclusive rights to Christmas, Reindeer, and other unspecified inventions. In addition, Microsoft will gain access to millions of households through the Santa Sleigh.\r\n\r\nThe announcement also included a notice that beginning Dec 9, 1998, Christmas and the Reindeer names would be copyrighted by Microsoft. This unprecedented move was facilitated by the recently acquired MS Court. Microsoft stated its commitment to "all who have made Christmas great," and vowed to "make licensing of the Christmas and Reindeer names available to all." It is believed that the guidelines for licensing these names, due before Halloween, will be very strict.\r\n\r\nWhen asked "Why buy Christmas?" Bill Gates replied "Microsoft has been working on a more efficient delivery mechanism for all of our products for some time, but recognized that the Santa Sleigh has some immediate benefits. We''ll use it first for the next release of Windows and Office 98."\r\n\r\nIn a multimedia extravaganza, the attendees were shown a seemingly endless video stream of products that make up the deal. It ended with a green and red version of the Microsoft logo, and a new Christmas 98 trademark, leading into the announcement of the first product from the deal.\r\n\r\nVixen, the new Director of Holidays and Celebrations said, "The first step is to assimilate Christmas within the Microsoft Organization. This will take some time, so don''t expect any changes this year." She continued, "our big plans are for next year, when we release Christmas 99. It will be bigger and better than last year." She further elaborated that "Windows 95 users who sign up with MS Network will get sneak previews of Christmas[99] as early as November first."\r\n\r\nChristmas 98 is scheduled for release in December of 1998, though one unnamed source said that it is dangerously close to the end of the year and may slip into the first half of 1999. An economist at Goldman Sachs explained that a slip would be catastrophic to next year''s economy and the nation''s tax revenue, possibly requiring the IRS to move the deadline for filing income tax returns to three months after Christmas, whenever that was. "But it could be good in the long term," he explained. "With Microsoft controlling Christmas, we may see it move to May or June, which are much slower months for retailers. This may serve to even out the economy over the year."\r\n\r\nWhen asked if other holidays are being considered, Mr. Gates explained that "Christmas is the flagship of holidays, so we wanted to start there.

You carry the chain looped in one hand in a peculiar fashion which permits the whole length of chain to be dragged from your hand without taking your hand and/or arm with it. You practice this beforehand till you''re sure you''ve got it right.\r\n\r\nThen you go into the cage with the tiger. Your friend does not. You gauge the tiger''s mood and put the leash on the tiger. There isn''t a whole lot more to say about this step except to say that that is why your friend is there, OUTside the cage. On your side is the fact that the tiger knows what the leash is for by this time and presumably is largely in favor of the idea.\r\n\r\nThis is where you find out that tigers are soft and poofy. They are also much, much larger than you had ever dreamed, when you''re standing next to one.\r\n\r\nThen you take the tiger for a walk. Your friend walks in front with the cane to clear the way. You walk with the tiger at your side, keeping pretty good control and letting the tiger know that you are Paying Attention, because if the tiger thinks you are not Paying Attention, it will do what housecats do, let you know that you should be Paying Attention. Unlike housecats, the tiger is big enough not to have to do anything truly outrageous to rectify the situation. Reaching behind you with one forepaw and sweeping your legs out from under you is generally considered good enough by most tigers. They think this is hilarious. To this extent, tigers differ from housecats in that they seem to have a sense of humor.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the tiger will see something that it wants. In this case, the tiger will go where it wants to go, and your job is to stop it. This is generally done by wrapping the chain around something that you pass, as the tiger drags you away. This will slow it down enough for your friend to jump on top of you and grab the chain as you go bulleting across the countryside. The weight of two adult humans will generally slow a tiger down enough to make things manageable, whereas one will not.\r\n\r\nIt is not usual for the tiger to react to freedom by turning around and turning you into fajitas, though this would actually (at least in the short term) be an eminently practical thing for the tiger to do. They enjoy their fun but are generally not ill-tempered. If they are they don''t get taken for walks.\r\n\r\nThey also purr like a freight train passing. Experts in the field claim that this is not purring, that it means something else, but you couldn''t put it by me. Sure sounded like purring, at 16-2/3 RPM, but it sounded like purring.\r\n\r\nAll in all, an experience I highly recommend as a lifetime source of cocktail party conversation, but it sort of tends to leave you limp for the rest of the day<br>more <a href=''http://www.jokershaven.com'' title=''Funny jokes''>Free jokes</a>', 'Active', 34, 9);

Remember, do not attach meaning to words, it''s symbolism that is important.\r\n\r\nAll - Clinton''s constituency. as: We ALL must make sacrifices to restore America''s economic health.\r\n\r\nAsk - Clintoneze for legislate. i.e. asking: legislating.\r\n\r\nCampaign promise - actually, this is a misspelling. It really is champagne promise.\r\n\r\nChange - (verb) redefinition of the term "tax cut" to its true meaning, "contribution". (noun) That portion of your income that will now be heading to Washington, As: The change we are asking for is necessary if we are to restore America''s (and, uh, Washington''s) economy to number one in the world.\r\n\r\nContribution - that portion of your "excess" income that Washington believes it can make better use of than you. This ''90s term is designed to make you feel good while Uncle Sam picks your pocket. Formerly known unpopularly as "taxes" (shhh. don''t say the T word out loud, it''s not politically correct).\r\n\r\nCourage - Ability to perform a humanitarian act or deed without regard to personal safety or welfare. As: America had the courage to elect Bill Clinton as president.\r\n\r\nFirst lady - This term has been replaced by the title "co-president"\r\n\r\nMiddle class - That portion of society whose range of income extends from the end of the poor to the beginning of the wealthy. Also known as the mule class or the "burdened" class.\r\n\r\nPoor - What the middle class becomes after it makes its contribution.\r\n\r\nSacrifice - Clintoneze for the act of denying self in order to make your contribution. as: We must sacrifice for the good of all. Formerly known as socialism, it has proven itself effective in places such as China, Cuba, Rumania and the Soviet Union. One need only talk to citizens of these nations to see the effect.\r\n\r\nSpending cuts- What the president promised during his campaign. He will help you make these by asking you to have the courage to make your contribution. as: Increased contributions must be balanced by the appropriate spending cuts.\r\n\r\nWe - You, me, us, them. As: You know we must sacrifice for the good of all. Since the president and congress are none of the above, they are not part of we.\r\n\r\nWealthy - Anyone making $1.00 a year more than you (elected officials are exempt). This is the class of society that, to quote Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, "made out like bandits during the ''80''s". Mr. Brown didn''t do too shabby himself during that time.

Certainly, it represents a considerable undertaking, and many of your statements do merit serious consideration. Unfortunately, the Declaration as a whole fails to meet recently adopted specifications for proposals to the Crown, so we must return the document to you for further refinement. The questions which follow might assist you in your process of revision:\r\n\r\n1. In your opening paragraph you use the phrase the "Laws of Nature and Nature''s God." What are these laws? In what way are they the criteria on which you base your central arguments? Please document with citations from the recent literature.\r\n\r\n2. In the same paragraph you refer to the "opinions of mankind." Whose polling data are you using? Without specific evidence, it seems to us the "opinions of mankind" are a matter of opinion.\r\n\r\n3. You hold truths to be "self-evident" . Could you please elaborate. If they are as evident as you claim then it should not be difficult for you to locate the appropriate supporting statistics.\r\n\r\n4. "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" seem to be the goals of your proposal. These are not measurable goals. If you were to say that among these is the ability to sustain an average life expectancy in six of the 13 colonies of at last 55 years, and to enable newspapers in the colonies to print news without outside interference, and to raise the average income of the colonists by 10 percent in the next 10 years, these could be measurable goals. Please clarify.\r\n\r\n5. You state that "Whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new Government...." Have you weighed this assertion against all the alternatives? What are the trade-off considerations?\r\n\r\n6. Your description of the existing situation is quite extensive. Such a long list of grievances should precede the statement of goals, not follow it. Your problem statement needs improvement.\r\n\r\n7. Your strategy for achieving your goal is not developed at all. You state that the colonies ought to be Free and Independent States, and that they are "Absolved from All Allegiance to the British Crown." Who or what must change to achieve this objective? In what way must they change? What specific steps will you take to overcome the resistance? How long will it take? We have found that a little foresight in these areas helps to prevent careless errors later on. How cost-effective are your strategies?\r\n\r\n8. Who among the list of signatories will be responsible for implementing your strategy? Who conceived it? Who provided the theoretical research? Who will constitute the advisory committee? Please submit an organization chart and vitas of the principal investigators.\r\n\r\n9. You must include an evaluation design. We have been requiring this since Queen Anne''s War.\r\n\r\n10. What impact will your problem have? .Your failure to include any assessment of this inspires little confidence in the long-range prospects of your undertaking.\r\n\r\n11. Please submit a PERT diagram, an activity chart, itemized budget, and manpower utilization matrix.\r\n\r\nWe hope that these comments prove useful in revising your "Declaration of Independence."

The complaint seeks an immediate injunction against the beloved Christmas icon, asking the court to effectively ban his traditional practice of checking the list of good boys and girls one additional time before packing his sleigh.\r\n\r\nThe suit, filed in the Federal District Court of Austin, Texas, asks a federal judge to "hereby order Mr. Claus to cease and desist all repetitive and duplicative list-checking activity, and certify the original list as submitted, without amendment, alteration, deletion, or other unnecessary modification."\r\n\r\n"There are no standards for deciding who is naughty, and who is nice. It''s totally arbitrary and capricious. How many more times does he need to check? This checking, checking, and re-checking over and over again must stop now," said former Secretary James Baker.\r\n\r\nBaker further claimed that unnamed GOP observers witnessed an elf removing all boys named Justin from the ''nice'' list, filing them under ''naughty'' instead because "everyone knows all boys named Justin are brats."\r\n\r\nGov. Bush cited the potential for unauthorized list tampering, and blasted what he called the "crazy, crazy mess up there at the North Pole."\r\n\r\n"Their security is really awful, really bad," said Bush.

Bush will become the Republican nominee for President, attention will soon focus upon whom Governor Bush will pick for his Vice Presidential running mate. It is rumored that one of the names on the ''short list'' currently being floated in upper level Republican circles is former Vice President, Dan Quayle.\r\n\r\nFor many, there seems to be some very sound reasoning for picking Quayle. As was pointed out by one senior official who wished not be identified, Quayle "already knows how to do the job, will contribute gaffes that will deflect attention away from Bush''s own, and in a cost saving side benefit will help the party minimize printing costs for new ''Bush-Quayle'' posters and bumper stickers (since they can use the leftovers from the 1988 and 1992 campaigns).\r\n\r\nApparently, part of the overall strategy is the targeting of a key demographic group that has been virtually ignored in previous presidential campaigns: Senile and confused voters. One recent survey puts the ''senile and confused'' at approximately 3.8% of the voting population. The hope is that this group will mistakenly believe that this is the same Bush-Quayle ticket they voted for in 1988 and 1992 and will once again cast their votes for another, albeit different, Bush-Quayle ticket. The dilemma facing Republican strategists however is determining how best to mount an effective campaign that will get out the ''senile and confused'' vote. One strategist sighed, "They''re a hard group to reach, let alone give instructions to."\r\n\r\nAdditionally, word has it that the former Vice President is undertaking some unique preparations for another run at the Vice Presidency.

Hillary and myself are shocked, outraged, and deeply saddened by this terrible misunderstanding. The media hype is way out of proportion. You guys should know us by now--we would never say anything like that. And though she did say a few things about Germany she certainly didn''t mean anything offensive by her remarks, which I might add have been willfully and shamefully taken out of context and distorted. There is nothing in my life, or Hillary''s life, which can be construed as derogatory toward the German people. We honor them. Some of our best friends are Germans. My own grandmother was one-quarter German. And it certainly isn''t true that Germans are excluded from our country club. In my eleven years as Governor of Arkansas I was responsible for hiring more German-Americans than my three predecessors combined. We have some pie charts which we''ll pass around for all you boys so you have the whole story. Once the American people know all the facts they''ll understand just how ridiculous this is.\r\n\r\nPart of this just naturally comes from being the frontrunner, although I never thought of myself that way or wanted to be called that. You boys just keep taking your best shots. The American people have seen the worst of me and they aren''t turned off by what we stand for. But this latest outrage is just too much. You boys ought to be ashamed. Sleaze for soundbites, trash for cash, that''s what this is. We have good reason to believe the audio tapes were doctored. We''re not even sure if that''s Hillary''s voice. You guys ought to have checked this out better before launching a major attack on my wife. The whole story was phony to begin with. In fact, our sources suggest that this is is just the latest manifestation of the vicious smear campaign orchestrated by the white house, who have declared many times that they will do whatever it takes to win this election. And that''s part of the reason that we''re so outraged about this--the very gall of the whole thing. The only Nazis you find in America these days are people like David Duke, who of course is a Republican, not a Democrat. But I certainly don''t mean to imply that George Bush has any Nazi skeletons in his closet. As I told Hillary just this morning, "Two wrongs don''t make a right."\r\n\r\nIt also comes as no surprise that Governor Brown has jumped on the bandwagon and has repeated these ridiculous charges every chance he gets. It is clearly in Governor Brown''s interest to do whatever he can to turn the discussion away from his "flat tax" proposal which would spell disaster for the people of this nation. And former Senator Tsongas, although he tried to claim he was above such things, has also chimed in with a few comments of his own and he maintains he isn''t even running any more. Unlike Senator Tsongas and Governor Brown, I''ve always tried to focus on issues, and God knows we''ve tried to avoid misleading or negative campaigning of any kind. (Turning up the heat, getting more dramatic.)\r\n\r\nThe millions of citizens of this great country who are out of work or scared of losing their jobs or their health insurance know what I stand for. People are genuinely disillusioned with the way things are in Washington, and this kind of sideshow just reinforces their disgust. People have been let down, they''ve been shafted by Washington. They want to know whether they have a vehicle for their resentment. I have always run my campaigns as a change agent. I''m as much of an outsider as anybody. I ran the first ad against the congressional pay raise!\r\n\r\nCertainly this is a sad commentary on the manipulation of the media, and the people, by evil forces who oppose our candidacy. Here we are trying to bring everyone together in this country so that we can work for the future, and once again vicious lies are spread about us and guerrilla tactics are used against us. Besides, I thought you guys were supposed to be on my side. It is just plain cowardice to keep bringing this up and attacking my wife instead of raising honest issues like the need for more submarines, my support for a middle class tax cut, the way Senator Tsongas wants to break the backs of poor honest retired folks by slashing their social security payments, how opposed I am to raising the gas tax, or the way Jerry''s flat tax would cripple the nation.

Hours upon hours I waited until that magic moment when, I felt this little movement. We called all of our relatives to tell them about the blessed experience.\r\n\r\nSecond Child: When it first happened, my wife called me at the office. I quickly ran home and felt the baby move. We included the experience in all of our letter to our family.\r\n\r\nThird Child: She told me the baby moved. I told her I would check it our during the next commercial break. I missed out because her mother called on the telephone so I went on watching Monday night football. By the end of the third quarter, I finally felt the baby move.\r\n\r\nFourth Child: We were in bed and I was trying to sleep. I turned to her and said "Cant you make your tummy stay still? I''m trying to sleep." When it became clear that the baby would be jumping around for a while, we called the pizza man for a delivery.\r\n\r\nThe Trip to the Hospital\r\n\r\nFirst Child: Every time we felt the slightest B&H contraction, we rushed to the hospital. I would carry my wife to the car and lay her down in the back seat surrounded by pillows.\r\n\r\nSecond Child: We timed the contractions. By the time she had three in thirty minutes, we rushed to the hospital. She sat in the front seat, with it leaned back and a pillow behind her head and another at her feet.\r\n\r\nThird Child: I came home from the office as soon as she started having regular contractions. When they were five minutes apart and hard, we went to the hospital. I gave her a pillow to hold along the way.\r\n\r\nFourth Child: When she called me at the office and told me that she was having contractions hard and five minutes apart, I told her to drive to the hospital. I would meet her there as soon as I finished the set of correspondence I was working on. I reminded her not to forget the pillows.\r\n\r\nThe First Step\r\n\r\nFirst Child: My wife grabbed the camera. I grabbed the Video Camera. My wife took four rolls of film. We immediately ran out to the one-hour developing place and had all four rolls developed with double prints. We had the best picture blown up to 24" X 36" and framed. We hung it up in the entry hall. I had a professional studio turn the four hours of video I taped into a one-hour documentary complete with voice-over by a local anchor-man.\r\n\r\nSecond Child: We took one roll of film and five minutes worth of video. The next day we took the film and had it developed by a twenty-four hour developing center. I took the best picture and put it into my wallet.\r\n\r\nThird Child: We couldn''t find the video-camera and we only had five shots left on the roll of film. We took all five shots but I don''t remember if we ever got the roll developed.\r\n\r\nFourth Child: I quickly got up and grabbed the camera.

And Abraham did look at her as though she were several saddle bags short of a camel load, but simply said, "How, Dear?"\r\n\r\nAnd Dot replied, "I will place drums in all the towns and drums in between to send messages saying what you have for sale and they will reply telling you which hath the best price. And the sale can be made on the drums and delivery made by Uriah''s Pony Stable (UPS)."\r\n\r\nAbraham thought long and decided he would let Dot have her way with the drums. The drums rang out and were an immediate success. Abraham sold all the goods he had at the top price, without ever moving from his tent. But this success did arouse envy.\r\n\r\nA man named Maccabia did secret himself inside Abraham''s drum and was accused of insider trading. And the young man did take to Dot Com''s trading as doth the greedy horsefly take to camel dung. They were called Nomadic Ecclesiastical Rich Dominican Siderites, or NERDS for short.\r\n\r\nAnd lo, the land was so feverish with joy at the new riches and the deafening sound of drums, that no one noticed that the real riches were going to the drum maker, one Brother William of Gates, who bought up every drum company in the land. And indeed did insist on making drums that would work only with Brother Gates'' drumheads and drumsticks.\r\n\r\nDot did say, "Oh, Abraham, what we have started is being taken over by others." And as Abraham looked out over the Bay of Ezekiel, or as it came to be known "eBay" he said, "we need a name that reflects what we are," and Dot replied, "Young Ambitious Hebrew Owner Operators."\r\n\r\n"YAHOO", said Abraham.

He was very pleased.\r\n\r\n"This is great!" he told God. "If this is hell, I REALLY want to see heaven!"\r\n\r\n"Fine," said God, and off they went.\r\n\r\nHeaven was a place high in the clouds, with angels drifting about, playing harps and singing. It was nice, but not as enticing as Hell.\r\n\r\nBill thought for a quick minute, and rendered his decision. "Hmmmm. I think I''d prefer Hell," he told God.\r\n\r\n"Fine," retorted God, "as you desire."\r\n\r\nSo Bill Gates went to Hell.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later, God decided to check on the late billionaire to see how he was doing in Hell. When he got there, he found Bill, shackled to a wall, screaming amongst hot flames in dark caves, being burned and tortured by demons.\r\n\r\n"How''s everything going?" he asked Bill.\r\n\r\nBill responded, with his voice filled with anguish and disappointment, "This is awful! This is nothing like the Hell I visited two weeks ago! I can''t believe this is happening! What happened to that other place, with the beaches, the beautiful women playing in the water????!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that?...That was a DEMO," replied God.<br>more <a href=''http://www.jokershaven.com'' title=''Funny jokes''>Free jokes</a>', 'Active', 17, 5);

"That''s more than twice the monthly payment you make for that (expletive)computer!" she continued as she escalated to screaming.\r\n\r\n"I confess! I confess!" I sobbed. "I''m just an on-line junkie. I''m addicted to my modem! I guess I''ll just have to join Modems Anonymous before I owe my soul to the phone company. "As a counselor for Modems Anonymous, I hear numerous variations of the preceding story every day. That insidious disease, modem fever, is exacting a tragically large toll from the cream of our society''s computer users. Modem-mania is sweeping through the very foundations of our country and there seems to be no stopping it. This disease (yes, it is a social disease of almost epidemic proportions) is becoming a such calamity that soon there''s even going to be a soap opera about on-line addiction named, "All My Modems. "\r\n\r\nIf you don''t already own one of those evil instruments called a modem, take warning! Don''t even think about buying one. Modem fever sets in very quietly; it sneaks up on you and then grabs you by the wallet, checkbook or, heaven forbid, credit cards.\r\n\r\nOnce you own a modem, you enter the insidious addictive trap by "dialing up" a friend who also has a modem. For some strange reason, typing messages to each other fascinates you. (Even if it is less than 10%of the speed that you can speak the same words over a normal voice phone link. )Of course, you make several attempts at hooking up before you finally figure out that at least one of you must be in the half-duplex mode; that discovery actually titillates you (sounds impossible, but it''s true).\r\n\r\nThen your modem-buddy (friend is too good a term) sows another seed on the road to on-line addiction by giving you the number of a local RBBS (Remote Bulletin Board Service). Once you get an RBBS phone number, you''ve taken the first fatal step in a journey that can only end in on-line addiction.\r\n\r\nAfter you take the next step by dialing up the RBBS your modem-buddy told you about, you find that it''s very easy to "log-on. "This weird form of conversation with an unattended computer is strangely exciting, much more so than just typing messages when you''re on-line with your modem-buddy. The initial bulletins scroll by and inform you about the board, but you''re too "up" to comprehend most of it. Then you read some of the messages in the message section and maybe, in a tentative manner, you enter one or two of your own.\r\n\r\nThat''s fun, but the excitement starts to wear off; you''re calming down. Thinking that it might be worthwhile to go back and re-read the log-on bulletins, you return to the main RBBS menu.\r\n\r\nThen it happens. The RBBS provides the bait that entices you all the way into the fiery hell of modem addiction. As you look at the RBBS main menu to learn how to return to the log-on bulletins, you find an item called FILES. By asking your host computer for FILES, you thread the bait onto the hook of corruption; the FILES SUBMENU sets the hook. You start running with the line when you LIST the files; you leap into the air with the sheer joy of the fight when all those public domain program title sand descriptions scroll by. They''re FREE!!! All you have to do is tell the bulletin board to download (transmit) them to you. You download your first program and you''re landed, in the creel, cleaned and ready for the cooking fires. In just 55 minutes after you logged-onto the board, you''ve downloaded six programs, one of them is Andrew Fleugelman''s PC-Talk, version 3 (truly an instrument for evil).\r\n\r\nBBS-LIST. DQC, which is also among the files you downloaded, contains a list of a great number of bulletin boards throughout the country. (There''s evil all around us, constantly tempting us!) You print the list and find about 60 RBBS phone numbers. (Have mercy on our souls!) The list also gives you the hours of operation, communications parameters and informs you about each board''s specialty. You decide to try PC-Talk and use it to dial-up an RBBS about three states away. Since the line is busy, you pass the time entering all those RBBS phone numbers into PC-Talk''s voluminous dialing directory.\r\n\r\nYou try the number again -- still busy. You think, "Hey, there''s one that specializes in Pascal programs. Maybe I''ll try it. It''s about half-way across the country, but it''s after 5pm and the phone rates have changed. It won''t be too expensive."\r\n\r\nThe Pascal board answers. After 45 minutes you''ve downloaded another five programs. Then you call another board --only this one''s completely across the country from California, in Florida. And so it goes on into the night . . . and the next night. . . and the next. . . . Some days it gets to you. You begin to feel the dirtiness of modem addiction, particularly when your wife makes you feel like a child by berating you for those astronomical phone bills -- if she hasn''t divorced you by then. Every time you sit down before your PC to do some work, you dial up another RBBS instead. If that one''s busy, you call another, and another, until you connect. Then you feel OK, almost "high." When you finally hang up, you still can''t work; you can only dial up another RBBS.\r\n\r\nYour downfall as an on-line addict is just another one of this society''s terrible tragedies, such as polygamy or the compulsion to circle all the numbers on computer magazine "bingo cards." Eventually your whole social life relies upon only the messages you find on electronic bulletin boards; your only happiness is the programs you have downloaded. (You never try any of them, you only collect them. )Hope exists, however. We, the dedicated but under-paid staff of Modems Anonymous, have done extensive research to find a cure for modem mania, which has been ruining hundreds of lives. And we have succeeded in our quest.\r\n\r\nThe cure is really quite simple, yet effective: Set up your own remote bulletin board service. Then all the other modem addicts will phone you, and their wives can nag at them about $450 phone bills, and you can find peace -- at last.<br>more <a href=''http://www.jokershaven.com'' title=''Funny jokes''>Free jokes</a>', 'Active', 10, 2);

Even if you''re certain that you are included in the will, it is still considered tacky to drive a U-Haul to the funeral home.\r\n***************************\r\n\r\nDINING OUT\r\n\r\n1. When decanting wine, make sure that you tilt the paper cup,and pour slowly so as not to "bruise" the fruit of the vine.\r\n2. If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your fingers covering the label.\r\n**********************\r\n\r\nENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME\r\n\r\n1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a taxidermist.\r\n2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table...no matter how good his manners are.\r\n***********************\r\n\r\nPERSONAL HYGIENE\r\n\r\n1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should be done in private using one''s OWN truck keys.\r\n2. Proper use of toiletries can forestall bathing for several days. However, if you live alone, deodorant is a waste of good money.\r\n3. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they tend to detract from a woman''s jewelry and alter the taste of finger foods.\r\n****************\r\n\r\nDATING (Outside the Family)\r\n\r\n1. Always offer to bait your date''s hook, especially on the first date.\r\n2. Be aggressive. Let her know you''re interested: "I''ve been wanting to go out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two years ago."\r\n3. Establish with her parents what time she is expected back.Some will say 10:00 PM; Others might say "Monday."

(very long)', 'Gender', '*** COPIED FROM A NEWSGROUP POSTING ***\r\n(the male author was responding to a woman who accidentally walked into the men''s restroom):\r\nPlease don''t feel bad. It wasn''t you entering the men''s washroom that caused that guy to pee on the guy next to him. Hell, we do that all the time. It''s rare for us guys to ever hit what were aiming for. Sometimes I go into the washroom, start to pee, and then just start spinning around; just so I''ll make sure I hit something.\r\n\r\nYou see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men''s penises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall because all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his penis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I''m telling ''ya those little buggers can''t be trusted.\r\n\r\nAfter being married 28 years my wife has me trained. I''m no longer allowed to pee like a man - standing up. I am required to sit down and pee. She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise if she had gone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on a pee soaked toilet seat, or fell right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seat down, she was going to kill me in my sleep.\r\n\r\nNow another thing us guys don''t usually like to talk about, but because you and I have become such good friends and you think I''m a classy guy, I might as well be candid with you because it''s a real problem, and you ladies need to be understanding. It''s the dreaded "morning wood".\r\n\r\nMost mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter how hard you try, you can''t get that thing to bend, and if it don''t bend you can''t aim, well hell, if you can''t aim you have no choice but to piss all over the wallpaper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on putting on the toilet.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers, the friggin'' toilet seat won''t stay up by itself. So that means we have to use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control ourselves for that perfect aim.\r\n\r\nNow sometimes, when you''re newly married, (and I know the guys in here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie.\r\n\r\nSo us guys will not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it''s just not safe. I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I told her... look, it won''t bend. She said, "sit down like I told you to do all the rest of the time." OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with "morning wood".\r\n\r\nWell it''s is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on the wall across the room. Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down under the toilet seat, when you start to pee the pee shoots out from the crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor in front of the toilet.\r\n\r\nI have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning urinary dilemma is to assume the flying superman position laying over the toilet seat.\r\n\r\nThis takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split time precision but it''s the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl during the first morning pee.\r\n\r\nSo you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally to blame. We are sensitive to your concerns about hygiene and bathroom cleanliness, but there are times when things just get beyond our control.\r\n\r\nIt''s not our fault, it''s just Mother Nature.\r\n\r\nNow, if it was Father Nature,... there wouldn''t have been a problem!!!<br>more <a href=''http://www.jokershaven.com'' title=''Funny jokes''>Free jokes</a>', 'Active', 8, 4);
